                Bangladesh, to the east of India on the Bay of Bengal, is a South Asian country marked by lush greenery
                and
                many waterways. Its Padma (Ganges), Meghna and Jamuna rivers create fertile plains, and travel by boat
                is
                common. On the southern coast, the Sundarbans, an enormous mangrove forest shared with Eastern India, is
                home to the royal Bengal tiger. â€• Google
